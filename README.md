# pojde Next Generation (pojde-ng)

[![Docker CI](https://github.com/pojntfx/pojde-ng/actions/workflows/docker.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pojntfx/pojde-ng/actions/workflows/docker.yaml)

## Overview

ðŸš§ This project is still a work-in-progress! ðŸš§

pojde Next Generation is a distributed multi-tenant development environment with web access to all components.

It strives to be ...

- **Open**: Free/libre and open source software under the AGPL-3.0 license
- **Versatile:** Supports multiple isolated instances on one host (for multi-user or multi-usecase support)
- **Fast:** Small base image with optional modules for languages and tools
- **Portable:** Runs on both Intel/AMD and ARM and requires Docker as the only dependency
- **Lean**: Built on projects like [code-server](https://github.com/cdr/code-server) and [Jupyter Lab](http://jupyterlab.io/)

With pojde Next Generation, you can **develop from any device with a browser!**

## Installation

To install `pojdectl-ng`, the management tool for pojde Next Generation, paste the following into your terminal:

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pojntfx/pojde-ng/main/bin/pojdectl-ng | bash -s -- upgrade-pojdectl-ng
```

Works on Linux, macOS and Windows (WSL2).

## Usage

pojde Next Generation is supports running many isolated instances on host, where the host can be your local machine, a cloud server or even a Raspberry Pi. Before you continue to the next step, please [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on the host that you wish to run the instance on.

To create your first instance, use `pojdectl-ng apply`:

```shell
$ pojdectl-ng apply my-first-instance 5000 # Append `-n root@your-ip:ssh-port` to create the instance on a remote host instead
```

Now follow the instructions. `pojdectl-ng apply` will ask you to download the CA certificate to your system, which you should do when creating the first instance; future instances will share this certificate. To trust the CA certificate, follow the videos we've created for you:

- [Trusting self-signed SSL certificates (Chrome on Linux)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byFN8vH2SaM)
- [Trusting self-signed SSL certificates (Chrome on macOS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PJc7RcMnw8)
- [Trusting self signed SSL certificates (Chrome on Windows)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyQ9IIxE3vc)

Note that you'll have to **select the CA certificate you've downloaded in the step before**, not download the certificate as described in the videos.

Once you've done so, list your instances with `pojdectl-ng list`:

```shell
$ pojdectl-ng list # Append `-n root@your-ip:ssh-port` to list the instances on a remote host instead
NAME                           STATUS     PORTS
my-first-instance              running    5000-5005
```

As you can see, our first instance (`my-first-instance`) is running and has exposed ports **5000** through **5005**. This port range has been selected when we ran `pojdectl-ng apply` above. You can now access the services (replace `localhost` with your remote host's IP or domain if you deployed to a remote host):

| Service                                           | Address                 | Description                            |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| [Cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org/)           | https://localhost:5000/ | A general management interface         |
| [code-server](https://github.com/cdr/code-server) | https://localhost:5001/ | VSCode in the browser                  |
| [ttyd](https://tsl0922.github.io/ttyd/)           | https://localhost:5002/ | Shell access from the browser          |
| [noVNC](https://novnc.com/info.html)              | https://localhost:5003/ | Graphical access from the browser      |
| [Jupyter Lab](http://jupyterlab.io/)              | https://localhost:5004/ | An interactive development environment |

Additionally, there is a SSH server running on port `5005` which you can use to forward ports with `pojdectl-ng forward`:

```shell
$ pojdectl-ng forward my-first-instance 4200:1234 4201:1235 # Append `-n root@your-ip:ssh-port` to also forward from the remote host to the local host
```

This, for example, forwards port `1234` in the instance to port `4200` on the local host and port `1235` to port `4201`.

**ðŸš€ That's it!** We hope you enjoy using pojde Next Generation.
