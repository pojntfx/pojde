## Installation

### Option 1: Docker

To install, run the following in your terminal (ZSH, Bash or PowerShell) and follow the instructions:

```bash
docker run --name pojde -v $HOME/Documents/pojde:/root/Documents:z -p 8022:22 -p 8000:8000 -p 8001:8001 -p 8002:8002 -p 8003:8003 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:z -d --privileged --restart always pojntfx/alpine-openrc:edge
docker exec -it pojde sh -c 'echo nameserver\ 8.8.8.8 > /etc/resolv.conf && wget -O /tmp/install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pojntfx/pojde/master/update-pojde && sh /tmp/install.sh && sleep 10 && exit'
```

You can find the content of the container's `Documents` folder in the `Documents/pojde` folder of your Docker host for easy data transfer.

For the next steps, continue to [Usage](#usage).

> Tested on:
>
> - Alpine Linux Edge with Docker 19.03.13 (x86_64) (Intel Server)
> - Alpine Linux Edge with Docker 19.03.13 (aarch64) (Raspberry Pi 4)
> - Fedora Linux 33 with Docker 19.03.13 (Intel Workstation)
> - macOS Big Sur with Docker 19.03.13 (MacBook Pro 2016 13")
> - Windows 10 2004 with Docker 19.03.13 (Intel Workstation)

### Option 2: Native Installation On An Existing Alpine Linux Installation

To install, run the following as root and follow the instructions:

```bash
sh -c "$(wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pojntfx/pojde/master/update-pojde)"
```

For the next steps, continue to [Usage](#usage).

> Tested on:
>
> - Alpine Linux Edge (x86_64) (Intel Server)
> - Alpine Linux Edge (aarch64) (Raspberry Pi 4)
> - Windows 10 2004 using WSL2 with [Alpine WSL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/alpine-wsl/9p804crf0395); if there are errors in the installation script, you can safely ignore them. Because of the way that WSL works, there is no support for the init system, so you'll have to start the IDE manually by running `supervisord -c /etc/supervisord.conf` as root. SSH forwarding is supported if OpenSSH server is enabled on Windows (see [Installation of OpenSSH For Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse)), but you'll have to specify the IP of the WSL virtual machine (i.e. by substituting `-L localhost:8000:localhost:8000` etc. with `-L localhost:8000:172.19.201.219:8000`). You can find the IP of the WSL virtual machine by running `ip addr` in Alpine WSL's shell.

### Option 3: Virtualized Installation With `alpimager`

1. Copy [packages.txt](https://github.com/pojntfx/pojde/blob/master/packages.txt), [repositories.txt](https://github.com/pojntfx/pojde/blob/master/repositories.txt) and [setup.sh](https://github.com/pojntfx/pojde/blob/master/setup.sh) to a local directory.
2. Change usernames, passwords, SSH public keys etc. in `setup.sh` to your liking
3. Get [alpimager](https://pojntfx.github.io/alpimager/), install it and create the disk image by running `alpimager -output pojde.qcow2 -debug`. If there are issues with the `nbd` kernel module, run `modprobe nbd` on your Docker host.
4. Increase the disk image size by running `qemu-img resize pojde.qcow2 +20G`
5. Start the virtual machine by running `qemu-system-x86_64 -m 4096 -accel kvm -nic user,hostfwd=tcp::8022-:22 -boot d -drive format=qcow2,file=pojde.qcow2`; use `-accel hvf` or `-accel hax` on macOS, `-accel kvm` on Linux. We are using a user net device with port forwarding in this example, but if you are using Linux as your host os, it is also possible to set up a [bridge](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Bridge) to access the VM from a dedicated IP from your host network and then start it by running `qemu-system-x86_64 -m 4096 -accel kvm -net nic -net bridge,br=br0 -boot d -drive format=qcow2,file=pojde.qcow2`. If you do so, there is no need to use `-p 8022` flag in the `ssh` commands below and you should replace `localhost` with the IP of the VM. Also, if you prefer not to use a graphical display, pass the `-nographic` flag to the startup commands above.
6. Log into the machine and resize the file system by running `ssh -p 8022 root@localhost resize2fs /dev/sda`. If you're running in a public cloud `/dev/sda` might be something else such as `/dev/vda`.
7. Setup secure access by running `ssh -L localhost:8000:localhost:8000 -L localhost:8001:localhost:8001 -L localhost:8002:localhost:8002 -L localhost:8003:localhost:8003 -p 8022 root@localhost`. If you do not setup secure access like so, the might be issues with webviews in Theia.
8. Continue to [Usage](#usage)

> Tested on:
>
> - Alpine Linux Edge (x86_64) (Intel Server)
> - Fedora Linux 33 (Intel Workstation)
> - macOS Big Sur (MacBook Pro 2016 13")

For Windows, please use the native installation on WSL2 (see [the alpimager docs](https://github.com/pojntfx/alpimager#installation) for why).

## Usage

### Access

To access the services, use the passwords you've specified in `setup.sh` and the addresses below. The default username is `pojntfx`, the default password is `mysvcpassword`. If you don't use SSH forwarding, didn't install using Docker or are on the machine that runs the IDE, you'll most likely want to replace `localhost` with the IP or domain of the machine that is running the IDE, i.e. `myide.example.com` or `192.168.178.23`.

- GoTTY: [https://localhost:8000](https://localhost:8000)
- Theia: [https://localhost:8001](https://localhost:8001)
- code-server: [https://localhost:8002](https://localhost:8002)
- noVNC: [https://localhost:8003](https://localhost:8003)

If you are accessing the serivces on localhost and trust the SSL certificate, please note that [HSTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) will be enabled for localhost. To prevent having HSTS on localhost, you may want to access the services using `localhost.localdomain` or `local.local` instead.

### Using a Domain

If you are using a domain, make sure to set the A records correcty:

```zone
A pojntfx.dev.alphahorizon.io 141.72.248.134
A *.pojntfx.dev.alphahorizon.io 141.72.248.134
```

### Trusting the Certificates

You'll have to trust the self-signed SSL certificate. I created some videos on how to do that:

- [Trusting self-signed SSL certificates (Chrome on macOS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PJc7RcMnw8)
- [Trusting self-signed SSL certificates (Chrome on Linux)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byFN8vH2SaM)
- [Trusting self signed SSL certificates (Chrome on Windows)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyQ9IIxE3vc)

If you are using a iOS device, read the following article: [Adding Trusted Root Certificates to iOS14](https://www.theictguy.co.uk/adding-trusted-root-certificates-to-ios14/). [code-server/issues/979](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/issues/979#issuecomment-557902494) might also be of use.

Note that Safari is not supported in Theia due to an [issue with WebSockets and HTTP basic auth](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=80362). To use Theia on Safari, open noVNC, add it to the homescreen and use Chromium in noVNC to browse to Theia; alternatively, you can use code-server.

### Updating

To update the IDE, run `update-pojde` in the terminal and follow the instructions.
